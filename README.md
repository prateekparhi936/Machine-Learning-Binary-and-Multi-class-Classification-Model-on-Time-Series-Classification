# Machine-Learning-Binary-and-Multi-class-Classification-Model-on-Time-Series-Classification

Jun 2019 – Jul 2019

Project description

• Classified the activities of humans based on time series obtained by a Wireless Sensor Network. Researched and extracted time domain features from the dataset.

• Estimated the standard deviation of each of the time-domain features you extracted from the data. Then, used Python’s bootstrapped method to build a 90% bootsrap confidence interval for the 
standard deviation of each feature.

• Developed Binary Classification models based on Logisitic Regression and L1-Penalized Logistic Regression.

• Developed Multiclass Classification models based on Naïve Bayes and MultiClass Classification.
